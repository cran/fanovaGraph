CHANGELOG for fanovaGraph

version 1.4.8
* adaption to igraph update
* importing non-base functions in NAMESPACE

version 1.4.7
* adding information on a non-standard dependency in the DESCRIPTION file
* fixing minor issue in pick-and-freeze method for estimate Graph

version 1.4.6
* fixing testthat compatibility

version 1.4.5
* new function thresholdIdentification
* improved vertex width scaling

version 1.4.4
* setting of vertex width supported again

version 1.4.3
* migration from igraph0 to igraph
* setting of vertex width not supported anymore

version 1.4.2
* in estimateGraph: full set estimation strategs implemented for method by Liu Owen and pick-and-freeze method (former Sobol method)
* new function i2Index for the estimation of pure second-order Sobol indices

version 1.4.1
* LHS-dataset added
* in estimateGraph: main indices no longer by sensitivity::fast99, but by new internal function mainEffectIndices

version 1.4
* bug for very small indices removed
* new S3 class "graphlist" with generic function plot 
* several functions and arguments renamed, most important: MLoptimConstraind -> kmAdditive, yhat -> predictAdditive
	
version 1.3.1
* unit tests by testthat
* adaptions to update in DiceKriging

version 1.3
* new parameters maximal edge thickness and circle diameter in function plotiGraph
* adaptions according to update to DiceKriging 1.3.3
* additional confidence intervals for "estimateGraph", method "FixLO"
* simplified input/output behaviour for all graph related functions: combined list structure as graph object


version 1.2

* The function MLoptimConstrained has been adapted to avoid rescaling between [-1,1]
(the limits for the optimizer are computed from the data)
* new function "totalIndex" for total Sobol indices of main effects

version 1.1

* new function simAdd to simulate from additive kernels
* new method for total interaction estimation "FixLO"
* bug fixed for isotropic and single cliques
* for kriging prediction yhat: changed input order, faster computation, prediction variance
