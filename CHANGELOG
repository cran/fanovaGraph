CHANGELOG for fanovaGraph 

version 1.3
* new parameters maximal edge thickness and circle diameter in function "plotiGraph"
* adaptions according to update to DiceKriging 1.3.3
* additional confidence intervals for "estimateGraph", method "FixLO"

version 1.2

* The function MLoptimConstrained has been adapted to avoid rescaling between [-1,1]
(the limits for the optimizer are computed from the data)
* new function "totalIndex" for total Sobol indices of main effects

version 1.1

* new function "simAdd" to simulate from additive kernels
* new method for total interaction estimation "FixLO"
* bug fixed for isotropic and single cliques
