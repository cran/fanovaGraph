Description: Estimation and plotting of a function's FANOVA graph to identify the interaction structure and fitting, prediction and simulation of a Kriging model modified by the identified structure. The interactive function plotManipulate() can only be run on the 'RStudio IDE' with 'RStudio' package 'manipulate' loaded. 'RStudio' is freely available (<https://rstudio.com/>), and includes package 'manipulate'. The equivalent function plotTk() bases on CRAN Repository packages only. For further information on the method see Fruth, J., Roustant, O., Kuhnt, S. (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2013.11.007>.
